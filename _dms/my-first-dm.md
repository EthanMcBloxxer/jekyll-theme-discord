## You've done it!
You have successfully started using the jekyll-theme-discord theme. Now all you have to do is edit `_config.yml` if you haven't already, and create new DMs! Also, delete this one in \\_dms\\my-first-dm.md or edit it and its name. If you make a new one, name it 1.md, then your next 2.md, and so on.
